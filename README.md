Please note that this is NOT an _official_ repo for blessed document.
[chjj/Blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) has its own documentation in its [README.md](https://github.com/chjj/blessed/blob/10edaa088bf239b8dbfac363cb757ac6941c9a90/README.md#documentation),
based on which I build this document site for better reading experience.
