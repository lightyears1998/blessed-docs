Please note that this is NOT an *official* repo for blessed document.

Both [chjj/Blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) and [yaronn/blessed-contrib](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib) place documentation in each project's `README.md` file,
based on which I build site just for better reading experience.
